      Inverted pendulum with a vertically driven pivot is one of the less 
      studied chaotic systems. This project models a typical Duffing's 
      oscillator, a well-known laboratory demonstration equipment of chaotic 
      motions. In the Lagrangian equation I used to obtain an ODE solution for 
      such a system, however, I assumed a perfect periodic movement of the 
      oscillator's pivot with a sine function, which is impossible in reality 
      due to the mass and inertia of the driving spring. I have implemented 
      this chaotic model by using Easy Java Simulation and tested its accuracy 
      by comparing my implementation against published parameters. Then I 
      implemented Fast Time Fourier (FFT) transformation model onto Ejs.'s 
      Ordinary Differential Equation solver to acquire a periodically-updating 
      power spectrum (SPD). The purpose of this study is to examine the 
      changes in the patterns of inverted pendulum's movement, which varies 
      back and forth from chaotic to periodic, through the lenses of Poincare 
      analysis and Fourier transformation.
